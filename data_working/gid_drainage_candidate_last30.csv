2457353,Stormwater,CHANNEL,"NOTE: TO JAKE VALENCIA & CREW4.	Undersized nature of City Auburn Creek street under crossings cause residential flooding.  The City permitted and constructed undercrossing for Auburn Creek were designed for flows that are now large because of a combination of greater Auburn Creek Channelization and the increased development, in the water shed, of impermeable surfaces.  Please have someone observe the Auburn Creek crossings at the following: a.	University Avenue at 51st /Ottilie Street (Number & size of drains undersized);b.	Wightman Street at the Wightman Street park (Auburn Creek channelized and flood plain raised for park);c.	Auburn Creek channel, Southwest of Wightman Street and Park, has an undersized zinc culvert for access to Apartment building.  (The Auburn Creek channel was moved and channelized to allow full development of the Auburn Creek Fox Canyon Flood plain);d.	Flooding of apartment buildings to the East of Wightman Street Park has been caused by inadequate storm water engineering.  The apartment owner annually sand bags the entrance to these apartments and when flood re-dry walls and paints.  I am confident that these apartments have significant mold behind the new dry wall.  (This storm water flood condition is because of the undersized under crossing of storm water from North of University Avenue.  As you know the Wightman Street Park, acquisition was as the result of an inverse condemnation action for flooding.  It was not acquired for flood control or park use. )e.	The Auburn Creek undercrossing, at Fairmount Avenue and Home, is undersized and mis ?designed.  It has flooded out this intersection and adjacent businesses every third year.  (I believe additional flow comes from lack of Auburn Creek maintenance, to the South behind the Goodwill and the Pearl Car Wash, and the fact that sections of Auburn Creek to the North of Fairmount were placed in a box culvert and channelized to eliminate the natural flood plain.  Additionally, the recent installation of free standing solar panel structures, at the Pearl Car Wash, now diverts large volumes of storm water directly into the Auburn Creek instead of the Storm drain system.  This diversion may improve the water quality but it increases the flow concentration and speed.)",2018-12-04T13:11:00,In Process,"UNIVERSITY AV & 54TH ST,, 92105",OK,32.74883602157728,-117.07960522931008

I purchased my home in La Jolla shores in 1969 and since the 1970's i have been aware of damage to  homes in this area caused by underground water. Also, I have been a licensed real estate agent since 1980 and I have observed much of the damage to the homes. Yesterday Sally Wegner, who resides at 2331 Calle Corta sent me the email as follows:""I just gave up fighting my water problems over the holidays and now with the rain it's impossible.  What I have gathered is that it must be underground water coming from the direction of Angie's going under K's driveway and under mine and the garage to the house.  The angle of the ground slope is right for that.  The garage  floor has been damp and it isn't from the car's AC draining.  Is there anything the City can/will do to stop it if it is underground water?""Sally Wegner has contacted you before regarding this problem and you did not have a solution for her.

I was hopeful something was going to be done a few months ago when work trucks came out, closed the street and began some sort of repair.

3843127,Stormwater,DRAIN INLET,"When rain comes down hard, it flows aggressively westward down Camino de la Costa and is directed to turn and flow into a storm drain just to the south of the driveway at 5792 Beaumont Av.  The problem is that this water flow when heavy, flows over the sidewalk and directly into the driveway and garage at that address.  The street storm drain cannot handle the water flow and as a result, the home gets the brunt of the water flow.  When this occurs, the homeowner ends up with an excess of inches of water in his garage.  This has happened several times now resulting in damage to the garage as well as items stored in it.  Please ask the assigned department to contact Steve Hadley srhadley@sandiego.gov for the accompanying video that was too large to attach to the GID request.Can city staff please come out and investigate the situation, and propose a solution?

Since I moved into my apartment 1.5 years ago, my apartment has flooded 5 times.  As you can imagine, I am growing quite frustrated.

I and others have pictures and videos of the clogged street drain flooding more than a foot deep during our storms.  Considering there is continued drain issues with this street drain, it doesn't sound unreasonable the continued leaking/flooding into my apartment could be caused by improper ground water run off from the street.

She was reassured it was a specific incident (which I knew was not the case because I had seen evidence several times before finally reporting it) and that it would not be repeated . The photos included here were taken at about 6:30 am today, 05/12/25, and the water remaining indicated it had been done hours earlier. The source was clear and the same as in the previous complaint. It indicates to me that the homeowner was disingenuous with the city and has not stopped the behavior. They have only changed the time of day so that people like me will not make reports. They got off with a warning the first time. I recommend a higher level of enforcement this time.

It was here when I moved in in 1991. I always thought it was a City drain from the paved alley just a couple of houses to the east of me. But I could never find a drain.  I recently learned that a neighbor across the alley at 325 Bonair has a pool on their back yard. Given the clear water emptying into my yard and ultimately the street, I believe the pool must be the source. Someone needs to run a camera up the pipe to see where it originates. Can someone help me figure out where this clear water is coming from? And what to do about it? It's a very old pipe and it looks like it runs across the alley and underneath my neighbor's house as well. If it is the pool, shouldn't the pool owner direct the pool drainage so it doesn't end up in my yard and then the street?

The drain has not been working for over a year.  On March 20 my neighbor sent me the attached photo showing a hole in the ground.  The workers are pointing their digging tool at the broken pipe.  On 3/22/25 I reported the breakage to your organization.  I was told they would first need to send a camera down the drain before doing the repair.  I never heard from them again.One hour after the rain on 10/14/25 I took the second attached picture showing a large standing puddle. The next morning the puddle had drained.My house is at 757 Armada Terr, directly across the street on the downhill side.  The draining of water through a broken pipe into the ground, directly under the street, can cause serious problems as you well know.  The land at this location is steeply sloped down to San Diego bay.  The broken pipe if not repaired could cause ground subsidence, land slippage or water intrusion into the downhill properties.I hope you can get this problem fixed soon.Please let me know you received this email and what the next step is.",2025-10-21T08:43:00,In Process,"757 ARMADA TER, 92106",OK,32.71708114404988,-117.23777692931866

Despite multiple complaints lodged with the management, no action has been taken to address this matter.My neighbor allows the waste to accumulate and then proceeds to hose it off the patio, letting it flow across the sidewalk and directly into the city drain. This practice not only contributes to the foul smell but also poses a significant health risk.I kindly request your immediate assistance in resolving this situation, as it is affecting the quality of life for the residents and potentially compromising public health.Thank you for your attention to this matter.Jared (760) 715-8020",2025-11-13T17:48:00,New,"8671 Via Mallorca, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA",OK,32.86466605709296,-117.23293204110448

As you can see in the picture it is adjacent to two high voltage transmission structures. The soil type on the hillside is a cobble and when any concentrated amount of water hits the hillside it easily erodes. We don't want to have a tower failure at this site due to the storm drain. It was patched in one area several years ago and the blockage at the bottom was cleared. However, it is leaking in other places uphill from the patch. we have installed BMPs to protect the towers but those are only temporary until the storm drain can be properly repaired. Due to the steepness and soil conditions this might be a prime candidate for relining. I must reiterate, there are four transmission circuits of critical importance to keeping the power on in San Diego. There are two 230kV, one 138kV and one 69kV on those two towers.",2016-08-09T19:01:00,In Process,"2255 Meadow Lark Dr, San Diego, CA 92123, USA",OK,32.78389936648045,-117.15385292366489
